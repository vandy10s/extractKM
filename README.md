# extractKM
The algorithm by Guyot et al.(2012) derives data from KM curve that are close to the original individual patient time-to-event data (IPD). The functions in this package map from digitised curves back to KM data using the algorithm in an easier and more convenient way. There are 3 functions which require different information types or conditions. To install the package using R, please run the commands below.
